# My professional portfolio page

## About:

The page is divided in two base sections, the side bar and the main container.

### Side bar:

In the side bar you can view my professional information in general, like my profile, social media links, known technologies, work experience and education.

### Main container:

This is where all of my projects can be found. Using the GitHub API, I programmed a JavaScript function to get all of my stored repositories projects, making a dinamic display for all existing and future projects.
